# Parallel Programming Inference on CNN LeNet Architecture

## Installation Instructions on Laptop for running GPU code, Prerequisite: Laptop with NVIDIA GPU Driver:

Setting Driver    
```
Software Updates (Ubuntu) -> Additional Drivers -> Switch to 535
```

Install CUDA 11.8 on your Laptop in Conda Environment
```
make setcuda
```

## Execution Instructions for Code:

### Subtask-1:

```

```
### Subtask-2:
Change the configurable parameters in the makefile under `sub2` and run `make sub2`. 
1. The command will be in the form of: `./subtask2 [function-choice: 1=convolution, 2=non-linear-activations, 3=subsampling, 4=converting a vector]`
2. For convolution the command would be changed to: `./subtask2 1 [N] [M] [P] [entries of matrix in row major order space separated] [entries of kernel in row major order space separated]`



### Subtask-3:
### Subtask-4:
